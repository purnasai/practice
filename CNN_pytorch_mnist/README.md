# CNN using Pytorch

## pytorch overview

I clearly explained about this in My webiste. please check it out [here](https://purnasai.github.io/Deep-view-on-Transfer-learning-with-Iamge-classification-Pytorch/)

From **Analytics vidhya** they say [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/02/pytorch-tutorial/) that 

PyTorch’s creators say that they have a philosophy – they want to be imperative. This means that we run our computation immediately. This fits right into the python programming methodology, as **we don’t have to wait for the whole code to be written before getting to know if it works or not. We can easily run a part of the code and inspect it in real time. For me as a neural network debugger, this is a blessing!**

PyTorch is a python based library built to provide flexibility as a deep learning development platform. The workflow of PyTorch is as close as you can get to python’s scientific computing library – numpy.

Now you might ask, why would we use PyTorch to build deep learning models? I can list down three things that might help answer that:

   **1. Easy to use API** – It is as simple as python can be.

   **2. Python support** – As mentioned above, PyTorch smoothly integrates with the python data science stack. It is so similar to numpy that you might not even notice the difference.
 
   **3. Dynamic computation graphs** – Instead of predefined graphs with specific functionalities, PyTorch provides a framework for us to build computational graphs as we go, and even change them during runtime. This is valuable for situations where we don’t know how much memory is going to be required for creating a neural network.
